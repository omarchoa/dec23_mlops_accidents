# 🛡️ SHIELD


## ℹ️ About

**SHIELD** (_Safety Hazard Identification and Emergency Law Deployment_) is an AI-powered Python app that uses machine learning to predict road accident priority levels, helping law enforcement optimize resources and maximize impact.


## 🧑🏻‍💻 Development Team

**SHIELD** is developed by:

- Fabrice **Charraud** ([@FCharraud](https://github.com/FCharraud))
- Omar **Choa** ([@omarchoa](https://github.com/omarchoa))
- Michael **Deroche** ([@miklderoche](https://github.com/miklderoche))
- Alexandre **Winger** ([@alexandrewinger](https://github.com/alexandrewinger))

**SHIELD** constitutes our final project for the [DataScientest Machine Learning Engineer Program](https://datascientest.com/en/machine-learning-engineer-course).


## 🏛️ App Architecture

**SHIELD** is designed following the [microservice architecture pattern](https://microservices.io/patterns/microservices.html), with an [API gateway](https://microservices.io/patterns/apigateway.html) serving as the single entry point for all clients, routing requests to the appropriate microservices.

**Figure 1** illustrates the global app architecture.

</p>

Each microservice runs in its own Docker container. Requests are handled by a dedicated micro-API in the container, and data persistence is implemented using Docker volumes. The entire backend (API gateway and microservices) runs on a single Docker network (`shield`).

**Figure 2** illustrates this sub-architecture, taking the `training` microservice as an example.

## 🎬 Getting Started for Developers

These instructions are divided into three sections:
- [🐳 Set up the Docker environment](#-set-up-the-docker-environment)
- [🗃️ Set up the app](#%EF%B8%8F-set-up-the-app)
- [⚙️ Use the app](#%EF%B8%8F-use-the-app)

---

### 🐳 **Set up the Docker environment**

#### 1. Get Docker

[Instructions](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) are available in the official Docker documentation.

#### 2. Create a Docker ID for use with Docker Hub

[Instructions](https://docs.docker.com/docker-id/) are available in the official Docker documentation.

_Example:_ [`fabricecharraud`](https://hub.docker.com/u/fabricecharraud)

#### 3. Create a Docker Hub repository to host your version of the app

[Instructions](https://docs.docker.com/docker-hub/repos/create/) are available in the official Docker documentation.

_Example:_ [`fabricecharraud/shield`](https://hub.docker.com/r/fabricecharraud/shield)

#### 4. Add the Docker Hub repository's name to your execution environment

Create an environmental variable named `DOCKER_REGISTRY` and assign to it the name of the Docker Hub repository that you created in [Step 3](#3-create-a-docker-hub-repository-to-host-your-version-of-the-app).

_Example:_

```shell
export DOCKER_REGISTRY="fabricecharraud/shield"
```

### 🗃️ **Set up the app**

#### 5. Clone the app's GitHub repository

[Instructions](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository) for a wide variety of methods are available in the official GitHub documentation, the simplest being the execution of the following command:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/omarchoa/dec23_mlops_accidents.git
```

#### 6. Set up a Python virtual environment

Using Python's `venv` module, with `sword` as the virtual environment name, run the following commands:

```shell
python -m venv sword
chmod +x ./sword/bin/activate
source ./sword/bin/activate
```

#### 7. Install the app's global dependencies

From the root directory of your local clone of the GitHub repository, run the following command:

```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### 8. Build the Docker container images and launch the app

From the root directory of your local clone of the GitHub repository, run the following command:

```shell
docker-compose -f ./src/docker/docker-compose-dev.yml up
```

#### 9. Push the Docker container images to Docker Hub

To upload the Docker container images to the Docker Hub repository created in [Step 3](#3-create-a-docker-hub-repository-to-host-your-version-of-the-app):
- Open a new terminal window.
- Go to the root directory of your local clone of the GitHub repository.
- Run the following command:

```shell
python ./src/script/push_images.py
```

---

### ⚙️ **Use the app**

#### 10. Check service status

To ping the API gateway, run the following command:

```shell
curl -X GET i http://0.0.0.0:8001/gateway/status/
```

You should receive the following response:

```text
"The API gateway is up."
```

#### 11. Try out the microservice features

The full, interactive list of endpoints is accessible via the API gateway's Swagger UI at [`http://0.0.0.0:8001/docs`](http://0.0.0.0:8001/docs).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Certain endpoints require **user authentication**. These can be accessed by passing the following string to the `Identification` field when executing the endpoints: `fdo:c0ps`.
>
> Other endpoints additionally require **administrator authorization**. These can be accessed by passing the following string to the `Identification` field when executing the endpoints: `admin:4dmin`.

#### 12. Stop the app

To stop the app, return to the terminal window that you used to launch it in [Step 8](#8-build-the-docker-container-images-and-launch-the-app) and press `Ctrl + C`.

#### 13. Resume the app

To resume the app, run the same command that you used in [Step 8](#8-build-the-docker-container-images-and-launch-the-app).

#### 14. Shut down the app

To shut down the app, run the same command that you used in [Step 8](#8-build-the-docker-container-images-and-launch-the-app), replacing `up` with `down`:

```shell
docker-compose -f ./src/docker/docker-compose-dev.yml down
```
